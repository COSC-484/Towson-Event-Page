This folder is to view the potential backend that has been created using mongodb, express, and mongodb Atlas



To run the backend of the server you need to navigate to the directory of the folder in your terminal then use npm run server, this will initalize the server on the local host 5000.

Once the server is running you can use postman to perform the post get and delete requests.
